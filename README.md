- 👋 Hi, I’m Erick Evans a design anthropologist focusing in User Experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in UX/UI Design and Research 
- 🌱 I’m currently designing VUIs and exploring different applications of UX design along with conducting research. I have experience in doing research, design, and some introductory front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that may need a designer or researcher, and I am also interested in working with any developers to improve my coding skills. 
- Open to discussing different design/research approaches, web development, social research, or anything else I have listed above. If I didn't mention it, I'd still love to talk about it.
